A Singleton class in Java is a class that allows only one object (instance) to be created throughout the program.
It is used when you want to ensure that only one instance of a class exists globally â€” for example, in logging, configuration, or DB connection managers.
ðŸ”¸ Steps to Make a Singleton Class:
Make the constructor private
â€“ So no other class can create an object directly.

Create a private static instance of the class
â€“ This holds the only object.

Provide a public static method to get the instance
â€“ This method returns the single object, and creates it if it doesnâ€™t exist.

public class Singleton {
    // Step 2: private static instance
    private static Singleton instance;

    // Step 1: private constructor
    private Singleton() {
        // private to prevent instantiation
    }

    // Step 3: public method to get the instance
    public static Singleton getInstance() {
        if (instance == null) {
            instance = new Singleton(); // lazy initialization
        }
        return instance;
    }
}


94. What is Collection framework?
The Collection Framework in Java is a set of interfaces and classes that help manage groups of objects efficiently.
It includes data structures like List, Set, Queue, and Map and provides powerful features for sorting, searching, and manipulating data.

ðŸ”¹ Major Interfaces in Collection Framework:
| Interface   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Collection  | Root interface for most data structures (List, Set, Queue)                 |
| List        | Ordered collection (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList)                           |
| Set         | No duplicate elements (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet)                             |
| Queue       | For holding elements before processing (e.g., PriorityQueue)               |
| Map         | Key-value pairs (not part of Collection but part of the framework)         |


âœ… Structure of Java Collection Framework

                   java.util.Collection (Interface)
                          /     |      \
                         /      |       \
                    List       Set      Queue
                     |          |         |
           ArrayList, LinkedList  HashSet, TreeSet  PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque

                    java.util.Map (Not part of Collection but part of collection framework)
                             |
                    HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap


95. What are wrapper classes?

96. What is cloning?

97. What is hash code and equal method?


99. Difference between Collection and Collections?
Collection:
Collection is a interface present in java. util.package. It is used to represent a group ofindividual objects as a single unit.
The List, Set, and Queue are the main sub-interfaces of the collection interface.
The add(), remove(), clear(), size(), and contains() are the important methods of theCollection interface.
Collections:
Collections is a utility class present in java.util.package. It defines several utility staticmethods like sorting and searching which is used to operate on collection.

101.) Explain Collection hierarchy? Explain List, Set and Queue?
Collection
Map List Set
Queue
Priority Queue
Hashmap Arraylist Linkedlist Treeset Hashset Linked
Hashset
1) List: - list is an interface.
List follows insertion order. It consist of duplicate elements. To use list interface we can use three classes.
i. Arraylist
The ArrayList class is a resizable array, which can be found in the java.util
package.it is internally work like a dynamic array.
ii. Linkedlist
We can use linkedList if there is no continuous memory of location. Adding data is easier than arraylist.it divided into 2 types â€“ i)single LinkedList , ii)Double LinkedList.
iii. vector
It work same as array but it is synchronized and give lower performance than ArrayList
2) Set : Set interface doesnâ€™t follow any insertion order and canâ€™t contain duplicate element.
We can use set interface by 2 classes. i.Hashset
It uses hashtable internally.it contains only unique element. It is synchronized and it doesnâ€™t
permit null element. It is the parent class of LinkedHashSet. LinkedHashSet use for remove duplicate element from an array. ii.Treeset
It is use for sort data in ascending order.
3) Queue:-
Queue is the parent interface of priority queue. Priority queue is follows FIFO(first in first out) order for adding and removing data. 102. Difference between ArrayList vs LinkedList and Vector?
ArrayList stores in continuous memory location where LinkedList doesnâ€™t required a
continuous memory location. ArrayList is non-synchronized where vector is Synchronized

103. Explain HashSet and HashMap?.
HashMap
HashSet
Data stores as key-value pair.
Data stores as object.
synchronized
Non-synchronized
Doesnâ€™t allow duplicate element
It contains single null key and multiplenull values.
It is slower than hashSet
Faster than HashMap.
Implement of set interface
Implement of map interface.

104. Internal working of HashMap?
It internally uses hashtable. It uses hashcode of the key object and this hashcode used to findindex of the bucket.

105. What is Collision and how to overcome this?
It is a situation where two or more key objects produce the same final hash value. Toovercome it each bucket consist of linkedlist in it.

106. Difference between synchronized hashmap and concurrent hashmap?
Synchronized hashmap
concurrent hashmap
synchronized but slower than concurrent hashmap
synchronized but faster
than synchronized hashmap
It locks whole map
It locks some portion of map

107. What is Ternary operator with example?
Comparable
comparator
1) Comparable provides a single sorting sequence. In other words, we can sort the
The Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences. In other words, we
collection on the basis of a single element such as id, name, and price.
can sort the collection on the basis of multiple elements such as id, name, and price etc.

108. What are unary operators and its example?
109.Enumeration
Iterator
Only consist read()
Have both methods remove(), read()
Access only vector and hashtable
Access any class in collection.

110. What are association and its type?
The ternary operator is an operator that exists in some programming languages, whichtakes three operands rather than the typical one or two that most operators use.
Ex:- < ,> ,? ,==

111. Difference between Iterator and List Iterator?
which takes one operands i.e. single input it is use to incrementor decrement value.
ex:- ++, --
List iterator is child interface of iterator.
Iterator travel in one direction having method next(), hasNext(). List Iterator travel in both direction having method previous(), hasPrevious(),next(), hasNext().

112. What is Fail fast and fail safe?
An association defines a relationship
between two entity objects based on common attributes. The relationship can be one-to-one or one-to-many.
