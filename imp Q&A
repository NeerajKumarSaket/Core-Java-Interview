Core Java Interview Questions
1. What is Java and why is it so popular?
Java is a versatile, class-based, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems and now owned by Oracle.
Its popularity stems from being platform-independent—“write once, run anywhere” via the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). 
Java’s stability, security, and wide adoption in enterprise applications, mobile apps (Android), web servers, and embedded systems contribute to its global usage. 
It also offers a vast ecosystem of libraries and tools, making it ideal for scalable application development.
Java is also backward-compatible and has a strong developer community, making it one of the most reliable programming languages for both beginners and experts.

2. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
JDK (Java Development Kit): Contains development tools like the compiler (javac) and debugger along with the JRE.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): Provides the environment to run Java applications; it includes JVM and standard libraries.
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes the bytecode generated by the compiler. It’s platform-dependent but ensures Java programs are platform-independent.
These components together form the core of Java’s architecture and enable cross-platform support.

3. What are the main features of Java?
Java offers several powerful features:

Object-Oriented
Platform Independent
Secure and Robust
Multithreaded
Distributed
Architecture-neutral
Its automatic garbage collection, memory management, and vast API support make it one of the most efficient programming languages for large-scale application development.

4. Explain the concept of OOP in Java.
Java is based on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), which revolves around:

Encapsulation: Wrapping data and code.
Abstraction: Hiding complex details.
Inheritance: Reusing code.
Polymorphism: Multiple forms of a method.
These pillars enable Java to build modular, maintainable, and scalable code, making it ideal for enterprise-level applications.
